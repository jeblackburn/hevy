**INSTRUCTIONS AND**
GUIDELINES FOR SUCCESS
**INSTRUCTIONS**
1.	 You will be provided with 20 workouts every 28 days. Workouts will be numbered from 1-20.  You
may jump into a workout at any number and can proceed to the next 28-day period once you have
completed all 20 workouts. Since my program utilizes a constantly varying 5-day split routine, you
will ideally be completing 5 workouts every 7 days.
2.	 The program allows for 2 rest days per week which should be utilized. I personally use the 2
weekend days for my rest days. I do, however, stay active and work on mobility, which may include
light stretching, myofascial or trigger point release, foam rolling, etc. If you want to burn extra calo-
ries, you may perform low-moderate intensity cardio work as well.
3.	 Each workout is programmed from start to finish using a letter system beginning with A. Start
each workout at A, then proceed to B, C, D, etc. Do not move on to the next letter before fully
completing the previous one.
4.	 The header of each lettered workout indicates what type of sequence (Superset, Giant Set,
Circuit, etc.) you will be performing and rest times. Additional rest times may also be found in the
body of the workouts.
**5.	 Warm-up:** A general cardio warm up (Rower, Dual Action Stationary Bike, Ski-erg, etc.) of
5-10 minutes that increases body temperature and warms exercising muscles is recommended,
but not required. Additionally, the first 1-2 rounds of every workout should be performed using
warm up weight for 10-15 reps. Click for Mobility Drills Guidelines
6.	 If you have questions about the program, please **DO NOT** message Paul via any form of
social media, as your questions will most likely not be answered. Paul receives 1000’s of direct
messages and post comments on social media daily and is unable to see or respond to all of them.
INSTEAD, **please complete the email form on the “** **Contact** **” page for the fastest reply.**

**7. Average workout time: 60 min** This will vary depending on the specific workout, users
fatigue and fitness level, accessibility to equipment, speed of reps and sets, recovery time, poten-
tial interruptions, etc.
**8.** If you have a limited amount of time on a particular workout day, try to perform as many sets
as possible during that time period.
**9.** Video links show demonstration of proper form. They do not show the amount of weight you
should be using. Use appropriate weight for the intensity described in each exercise.
**10.** If there is an exercise listed in the program that you cannot complete due to equipment avail-
ability, you may substitute a resistance band that is compatible with the weight effort described
and attach it to a stable structure closest to what is described or shown in video demonstration.
**11.** If you are not yet able to perform unassisted pull-ups or chin-ups, you may perform them with
band assistance.
**AVERAGE WORKOUT TIME:**
**60 MIN**

**GUIDELINES**
1.	 I do not always count reps so please use them as a guideline. However, all sequences, super-
sets, giant sets, and circuits do have a designed rep count that is to be followed as best as you
can, along with a time range for rest in between sets.
2.	 Maximize your time under tension and contraction during all exercises. Movements should be
controlled unless otherwise noted. Concentration and focus are essential to proper contraction
and mind body connection. Connecting with your muscles will lead to better and faster results.
3.	 With all forms of exercise, injury is always a potential risk and possibility. The key to minimizing
injury is proper form and alignment. Slower, stronger reps can prevent you from passing a point in
range of motion where injury could possibly occur.  A strong foundation leads to a rock-solid body.
4.	 Attention to detail when performing every exercise is crucial to your success. Finishing an
exercise or sequence and not feeling the specific muscle groups or cardio effect will lead to subpar
results. Understanding your body and realizing its limitations is extremely important. Be intuitive
with every aspect of your fitness regimen.
5.	 It is recommended that you consult your doctor or medical care practitioner before starting this, or
any exercise program, especially if you have underlying medical conditions.
6.	 Always try to use the specified piece of equipment. However, if access to barbells, dumbbells,
and kettlebells is limited, they all may be used in place of one another.
7.	 A rested body regenerates quicker and allows for more intensity during prescribed workouts.
8.	 NEVER go more than 2-3 days without working out unless a life event gets in the way.
9.	 Your success and results with my program also depend on your mental approach and how much
effort you apply. Missing workouts, eating poorly, lack of effort-consistency-focus, your current fit-
ness level, genetic predisposition, athletic disposition, are all factors that can affect your outcome.
10.	 Approach every workout with as much energy, intensity, and focus as you can on any given day.
11.	 Utilize the Nutritional Guidelines supplement to help compliment your results.
12.	 Seize any opportunity to find fitness.
13.	 Do your best and never cut corners.

**GLOSSARY**
OF TERMINOLOGY
**WARMUP WEIGHT:** Very light to warm up all of
the joints involved. Should increase heart rate and
blood flow and prepare the body for heavier sets.
**LIGHT/MEDIUM WEIGHT:** Weight is easy to
control through full range of motion and allows
for a very strong muscular contraction.
**MEDIUM TO MODERATE WEIGHT:** A weight
that is challenging but not overbearing. You
should be able to complete full range of motion
with this workload.
**MEDIUM PLUS WEIGHT:** Heavy enough to take
you out of a medium comfort zone.
**HEAVY WEIGHT:** Should be heavy but you should
be able to lift approximately 2 more reps than
prescribed. i.e. if the set calls for 5 repetitions you
should be able to complete 6-7 repetitions.
**AS HEAVY AS POSSIBLE TO COMPLETE:** This
is a weight that you should not be able to lift more
than the prescribed number of reps. If the set
calls for 5 repetitions, you should not be able to
perform 6 repetitions.
**SETS AND REPS:** the first number is the number
of sets, the second is the number of reps For
example, 2 x 12 means 2 sets of 12 reps each
**TO FAILURE:** The point during a set in which you
can no longer complete a rep with good form.
**SUPERSET:** Performing two exercises back to
back without rest
**GIANT SET:** Performing multiple exercise back to
back without rest
**FINISHER:** Exercise or series of exercises
performed at the end of a workout designed to
reinforce muscle contraction and exhaust muscles
used during the main workout.
**ROUND:** A complete series of bundled exercises,
similar to a set
**PLYOMETRIC (PLYO):** an exercise that involves a
stretch reflex and is ballistic in nature. The muscle
stretches quickly as it contracts simultaneously
during the eccentric, or commonly referred to as
“negative” portion of a muscle contraction
